## Description
A file organizer with GUI and a .exe compilation.\
The compiled app file_organizer_gui.exe is in a dist folder.

### Features:
1. The user can enter input and output paths in the fields or select them using the file explorer.
2. If the user presses the 'Organize' button - the app will check:
    - if the path entered
    - if the folder:
      - exists;
      - readable;
      - writeable;
      - is not empty.
3. If there's an issue, the app shows a window with the error message.

5. Sorts files by their extensions into folders by type.
6. This script can't delete the files, so they're safe.
